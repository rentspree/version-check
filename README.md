## Overview

When deploying a new React Application version, do you still assume all users will refresh to get the new version? Your assumption is right until you find that very user who open the browser for days without refreshing. And when you found it, it already causes you error in your application. So why bother?

This Lib help React application periodically fetch an API server to get its version. It compares the version and execute refresh if a newer version is available!

```
npm install @rentspree/version-check
```
